<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 325F or 160C</li>
    <li>Prepare graham cracker crust by combining graham cracker crumbs, sugar and brown sugar and stirring well. Add metled butter and use a fork to combine ingredients well</li>
    <li>Pour crumbs into springform pan and press firmly into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Set aside</li>

    <li>Add sugar and stir again till creamy</li>
    <li>Add sour cream, vanilla extract and salt and stir until well combined</li>
    <li>With mixer on low speed, gradually add lightly beaten, eggs one at a time, stirring until each egg is just incorporated</li>
    <li>Pour cheesecake batter into preapred pan. To prevent leaks place pan on a cookie sheet that has been lined with foil</li>
    <li>Transfer to your oven and bake on 325F for about 75 minutes. Edges will likely be <strong>slightly</strong> puffed and may begin to turn a light golden brown and the center should spring back to touch but will still be jello-jiggly. Don't over bake or the texture will suffer</li>
